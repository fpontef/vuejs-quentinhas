# VueJS FrontEnd for API REST

> A Vue.js project using brownserify

The goal for this project is to implement a REST API backend I built for a class work.
It wasn't mandatory, but had to build something different and had the change to try 
those tech I'm already studying, like Javascript and VueJS Library.

Backend using a [REST API with Laravel PHP Framework](https://github.com/sobralense/restphp-quentinhas).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
